Computing with Large Content , Small Devices  and Useful Understanding

I am developing a facility where software requirement in plain text are split into small portions called Cues. These Cues have a name from a dictionary and some of these cues has executable code in the form of a function. So the end product - the software is ultimaely a bunch of cues some how[to be described below] connected semantically and also through executables.
The benifit of this approach is programming in small and programming in large coexist beautifully opening up a clear and precise way to locate something useful for maintenance and further development. Any of the said contents ie requirements and codes can be physically located any where in a distributed world.
Definitions and Concepts:

Words : By the term 'word' I mean any signficant word or phrases for a subject matter. They are the smallest units of text that relate to something within a subject matter.
Cue : A Cue is a collection of words [not more than 10 ] that has a name which by itself is a word. A cue thus reflects a stae of our short term memory while we are in a process of creating or understanding s subject matter.
Flow : A flow is a sequence of Cues which reflects the process of progressively understanding or deriving a Cue at the end of the flow.
This project  gives a way to represent the two mental states of Cue and Flow is a way that helps us create content ,understand content and learn new skills, while allowing us to develop software interms of those items which human beings understand.
Requirement : any software requirement is thus seen as a sequence of elaboration through Cues, which in turn make up a flow.
We shall see any Cue is addressable as a sequence of dot seperated words ,known as a Uniform Context Language. Each of the words in a UCL represent a name of a Cue.
The adddress of a Cue in turn also represnts the flow that places  the Cue in the context uniqely formed for the Cue. Thus the structure of a content is defined by the content itself.
