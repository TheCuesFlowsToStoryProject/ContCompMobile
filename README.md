Computing with Large Content , Small Devices  and Useful Understanding

I am developing a facility where software requirement in plain text are split into small portions called Cues. These Cues have a name from a dictionary and some of these cues has executable code in the form of a function. So the end product - the software is ultimaely a bunch of cues some how[to be described below] connected semantically and also through executables.
The benifit of this approach is programming in small and programming in large coexist beautifully opening up a clear and precise way to locate something useful for maintenance and further development. Any of the said contents ie requirements and codes can be physically located any where in a distributed world.
